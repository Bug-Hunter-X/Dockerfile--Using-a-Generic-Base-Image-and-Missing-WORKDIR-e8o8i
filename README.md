This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile issue where using a generic base image and not specifying a WORKDIR can lead to issues.  The solution involves using a more specific base image and setting a WORKDIR.  The Dockerfile uses a very generic base image (ubuntu:latest), which can lead to very large image sizes and security vulnerabilities. It also doesn't specify a WORKDIR, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
